met rio.he is black labrador.A dog is known as man’s best friend because
of the way dogs are loyal and friendly to their masters. Just like every
dog owner, children love dogs more than anything in the world. It’s not 
just about children, anyone with a pure heart simply can not deny that
they love dogs, unless they are actually allergic to dogs. For the
families that have dogs, they are not just pet animals, but a true
member of their family. Through this essay on My Pet Dog, we will be
talking about all the adorable and lovely things that dogs do.

Rio is not just our family member, he is the most clever member of our
family. He will play games with us, keep all our family members together
with his love and cuddles and also he keeps thieves and uninvited guests
out of our home. My pet dog is the best thing ever that has happened to 
me in my life.

I am not a pet parent or a guardian: I OWN my dogs.
While this may make many readers cringe, the terms 
‘pet parent’ and ‘pet guardian’ really make me squirm.
</p>
<p>
They drink spring water, they have three freezers full of fresh food taking 
up much of my garage (much to my husband’s chagrin), I never think to go 
out for  a ride without them (unless the weather is too hot), and I refer 
to myself as ‘mommie’ when I talk to them (which I do a lot).  So why 
don’t I call myself a pet parent?
